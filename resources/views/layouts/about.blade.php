        <p>In a time when stores are limiting capacity shopping 
        in person has become a struggle. Often times shoppers have gone 
        to a store only to find out that there is a long line to enter. WHY WAIT?
        Waiting is no longer a nessasary thing. With WHY WAIT you can easily 
        set up an appointment with your favorite brick and mortar 
        businesses and skip the line. You can also leave comments 
        and let other users know about a businesses wait time and how they did.
        WHY WAIT isn't only for shoppers. Businesses to can keep
        track of their appointments. They can also keep track of 
        their current capacity! This feature can be accessed from 
        multiple devices if a business has multiple entries and this 
        way they can keep full count of the shoppers in their store!
